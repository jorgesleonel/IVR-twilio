# Basic IVR (voice portal) using Twilio API

This is a simple voice portal implemented in PHP leveraging the powerful Twilio voice API

The code is straightforward

. in first couple of lines, variable $user_pushed is created & associated with phone keyboard input

. switch control command will then execute a different action depending on number pressed

. most of this functionality is enabled through a combination of say (sound is played to end user) and gather (input) Twilio TwiML directives
